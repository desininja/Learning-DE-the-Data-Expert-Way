Dear Student,

Thank you for your submission of "Assignment-1 Submission.sql". Below is detailed feedback on each task within your file:

### Task 1: DDL for the actors table

- **Custom Data Type**: Excellent job defining custom data types such as `films` and `quality_class`. These enhance the semantic clarity of the data model.
- **DROP TABLE**: Including the `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS` statement safeguards against errors when recreating the table.
- **Table Structure**: The composite primary key `(actorid, film_year)` is well thought. This ensures uniqueness per actor year. One suggestion would be to align naming conventions by using snake_case (e.g., `actor_id`, `film_year`, etc.) for consistency.

### Task 2: Cumulative Table Generation Query

- **CTE Usage**: You’ve successfully utilized CTEs to break down complex logic into manageable parts. This not only aids readability but also improves maintainability.
- **Logic for Films Array and Quality Class**: The logic provided for handling new, returning, and inactive actors is sound. Coupling this with decisions based on ratings is a good method to assign `quality_class`.
- **Active Flag**: Using `TRUE` for active actors and `FALSE` for inactive ones is straightforward, though consider handling unknown states in the future for completeness.

### Task 3: DDL for actors_history_scd Table

- **Custom SCD Type**: The `ac_scd_type` is well-structured and encapsulates pertinent details for a slowly changing dimension.
- **Table Definition**: You’ve correctly defined the table structure with an appropriate primary key. However, consider including comments in your code for better understanding of the SCD process by third parties.

### Task 4: Backfill Query for actors_history_scd

- **Change Detection**: Implementing lag functions to detect changes in `quality_class` or `is_active` status is effective. 
- **Streak Logic**: This indicates a strong understanding of change tracking within data timelines.

### Task 5: Incremental Query for actors_history_scd

- **CTEs for Incremental Process**: Your designed CTEs effectively manage new, unchanged, and changed records. The decomposition into several CTEs allows for granular understanding and efficient process.
- **Efficient Use of UNNEST**: Creativity is shown with the use of `UNNEST` and custom type arrays; this is advanced usage.
- **Overall Efficiency**: The process efficiently integrates historical data with new entries, vital for SCD Type 2 systems.

### General Observations

- **Clarity and Structure**: Your SQL scripts are organized, methodical, and easy to follow. Proper indentation and use of comments can help maintain this clarity and would be appreciated in future submissions.
- **Advanced Concepts**: You’ve demonstrated a solid grasp of advanced SQL concepts such as CTEs, window functions, and custom data types.

### Suggestions for Improvement

- Consistently use comments to describe the purpose of blocks and logic for better clarity and maintainability.
- Consider using consistent naming conventions throughout to improve readability.

### Final Remarks

Overall, your submission showcases a comprehensive understanding of database structures, SQL conventions, and intricate operations using SQL. Excellent work in leveraging your knowledge and applying it practically.

### FINAL GRADE:
```json
{
  "letter_grade": "A",
  "passes": true
}
```

Your work is impressive, demonstrating both technical ability and thoughtful application of concepts.

Best regards,
