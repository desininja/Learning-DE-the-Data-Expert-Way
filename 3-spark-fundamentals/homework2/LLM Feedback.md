** This feedback is auto-generated from an LLM **



Thank you for your submission. I have reviewed the files you provided. Here are my comments and feedback for each part of the assignment:

1. **Query Conversion:**
   - You have successfully converted two PostgreSQL queries into SparkSQL within your PySpark jobs located in the `actors.py` and `device.py` files. The `actors.py` handles the transformation of game details, and `device.py` processes event data to perform deduplication.
   - Both queries use appropriate SQL constructs, such as `WITH` clauses and `ROW_NUMBER()`, to achieve their respective goals. They're implemented correctly for the given context.

2. **PySpark Jobs:**
   - Both jobs (`actors.py` and `device.py`) define functions to execute SparkSQL queries on DataFrames, which is in line with common practices for structuring PySpark applications.
   - Each job includes a `main()` function to create the Spark session and execute the transformation, saving results back into tables. This is a good practice for ensuring that your transformations are encapsulated and can be executed independently.

3. **Tests:**
   - The test files, `test_actors.py` and `test_device.py`, use the `chispa.dataframe_comparer` library to assert DataFrame equality, which is well-suited for testing PySpark jobs.
   - The test `test_game_details_edge_transformation()` creates a DataFrame with sample input data and checks the actual DataFrame output against the expected output. It correctly handles row comparison.
   - Similarly, `test_device_transformation()` verifies that duplicates are removed from the input data.
   - Both tests use clear and relevant test data. However, you could improve the robustness of your tests by adding additional test cases to cover edge scenarios outside the current test data.
   
**General Feedback and Best Practices:**
- Ensure that all functions and SQL variables within your Python modules have docstrings for clarity and maintainability.
- Consider restructuring the test data with more diverse and edge-case scenarios to detect potential edge conditions or bugs.
- Verify that your Python modules follow PEP 8 standards for style and formatting, as this helps maintain code readability.

Overall, you have demonstrated a good understanding of converting SQL queries into SparkSQL and integrating them into PySpark jobs. The tests you provided are solid, and they effectively verify the primary functionality of your code.
