** This feedback is auto-generated from an LLM **



Here is your feedback for your submission:

1. **Query 1**: You correctly configured Spark to disable the auto-broadcast join with `spark.conf.set("spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold", "-1")`. Excellent!

2. **Query 2**: You performed an explicit broadcast join on both the `medals` and `maps` tables as specified. Your use of the broadcast function ensures efficient joins with these small tables. Well done!

3. **Query 3**: The bucketing implementation looks good. You correctly used 16 buckets for bucketing `match_details`, `matches`, and `medals_matches_players` tables on the `match_id` field. Your use of Iceberg tables is clear, but ensure you stay within assignment constraints which do not mention Iceberg. The requirement was bucket joins, which you've implemented effectively.

4. **Query 4 (Aggregations)**: 
   - **Query 4a**: The solution for finding the player with the highest average kills per game is correct. You used appropriate aggregations and ordered the results correctly.
   - **Query 4b**: Your query to find the most played playlist is correct. Using `countDistinct` on `match_id` is an appropriate choice to ensure you're counting unique matches.
   - **Query 4c**: Identifying the map with the most plays was implemented correctly. 
   - **Query 4d**: You applied the filter for "Killing Spree" medals and then did a summation correctly to find where players received these medals most frequently. Good application of aggregations.

5. **Query 5 (Optimizations with Partitioning and Sorting)**: You haven't explicitly provided any solutions showcasing partitioning and using `sortWithinPartitions`. This task requires experimenting with partitioning strategies to evaluate data size impact. This needs to be addressed to ensure coverage of all assignment tasks.

6. **Code Quality and Efficiency**: 
   - Your use of Scala for the PySpark assignment seems like a mismatch, as the task specifies using PySpark. Ensure you follow the specified language or clarify if instructions allow different languages.
   - Your implementation includes all necessary steps to set up and optimize queries. The comments are generally clear, although verbosity could be reduced.
   - Future submissions should address usage of other languages if required, providing PySpark alternative code.

In conclusion, your submission demonstrates good understanding and execution of joins and aggregations in Apache Spark, with a few areas needing clarity around language specifications and exploration of partitioning optimization. 

FINAL GRADE:
```json
{
  "letter_grade": "B",
  "passes": true
}
```
Focus on fulfilling each task thoroughly and consider delivering the assignment in the requested format. If you have any questions about the use of Scala or need further guidance, feel free to reach out!
