Thank you for your submission. Let's go through different aspects of your work to evaluate its correctness, code quality, testing instructions, and documentation.

### **Correctness:**
1. **Flink Job:**
   - You correctly set up a Flink job to sessionize the data using a 5-minute gap as specified. You use the `Session.with_gap` to implement the sessionization based on the `window_timestamp`.
   - The sessionized data is written to a PostgreSQL table with the correct schema that includes `event_hour`, `ip`, `host`, and `num_hits`.

2. **SQL Script:**
   - The SQL queries provided in `avg_session_events.sql` are correctly structured to calculate the average number of web events per session for hosts under the `techcreator.io` domain.
   - You have also included a query to compare results across specified hosts, which seems to function as intended given the sample results.

### **Code Quality:**
1. **Flink Job Script:**
   - Your code is well-structured and easy to follow. The use of functions for creating the PostgreSQL sink and Kafka source enhances readability.
   - Logging for error handling is a good practice; however, consider adding more detailed logs to help track the job’s progress and debug if necessary.
   - Consider adding comments or docstrings to elaborate on the purpose of each function and major code block.

2. **SQL Script:**
   - SQL queries are clean, logically structured, and make effective use of SQL functions such as `AVG()`, `COUNT()`, and `SUM()` for aggregation.

### **Testing Instructions:**
- Your `readme.md` provides clear instructions for setting up the environment, running the Flink job, and executing SQL analysis.
- The procedures for running the necessary Docker commands and initiating the Flink jobs are well documented.

### **Documentation:**
- Your submission includes a brief yet informative explanation of the project’s objectives and usage in `readme.md`.
- You included the required average session event details in `avg_session_events.sql` and provided context about the results in your documentation.

### **Areas of Improvement:**
1. **Error Handling:**
   - In addition to logging errors, consider implementing retry mechanisms or fallbacks for robustness, especially in production scenarios.
    
2. **Code Comments:**
   - Enhance your code with comments explaining your logic, especially around configurations and transformations. This will aid future maintainers or collaborators who might work on your code.

Overall, you have met the homework requirements effectively and provided clear documentation and structured code. 

### **FINAL GRADE:**
```json
{
  "letter_grade": "A",
  "passes": true
}
```

Great work on the assignment! Keep up the effort and consider the suggestions to further improve your work.
