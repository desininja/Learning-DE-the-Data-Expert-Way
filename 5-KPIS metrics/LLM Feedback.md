Hello,

Thank you for submitting your detailed analysis of Spotify along with your proposed experiments. I’ll provide feedback focusing on both the user journey and your experiment design.

### User Journey

Your account of the user journey is compelling and thoroughly outlines the transition phases from initial discovery to becoming an active user. You effectively highlighted the features that made a strong impact on you, such as "Discover Weekly," personalized playlists, cross-device continuity, and Spotify Wrapped. Each phase is well-articulated and showcases how Spotify has been integrated into daily life. Excellent work here!

### Experiment Design

**Experiment 1: Enhanced Discover Weekly**

- **Test Design**: The allocation into three different test cells is well-considered. It allows for a nuanced understanding of user preferences towards frequency and volume of song updates.
  
- **Hypothesis**: The hypothesis is clear and targets increased engagement, which aligns with the frequent content updates.

- **Metrics**: The leading and lagging metrics are well-chosen and relevant to the test. Metrics like sessions per user and weekly retention rate are directly applicable.

**Experiment 2: "Story-Driven" Podcast Recommendations**

- **Test Design**: The two-cell setup provides a straightforward comparison between current and new formats. It's clear and allows for clear attribution of engagement changes.
  
- **Hypothesis**: The narrative hook as a driver for engagement is a solid strategy. Including episode progress tracking strengthens the hypothesis.

- **Metrics**: You’ve selected effective metrics such as completion rates and number of episodes played. The alignment with the hypothesis is excellent.

**Experiment 3: Collaborative Playlist Invitation**

- **Test Design**: The setup of a simplified invitation process is smart, focusing on ease of use to drive social sharing.
  
- **Hypothesis**: The hypothesis is practical and considers user behavior—reducing barriers often increases engagement.

- **Metrics**: The chosen metrics are on point. Monitoring shares, playlist creation, and new user acquisition ties directly to the success of social features.

### Overall

Your submission is comprehensive and meticulously detailed, from laying out the user journey to articulating well-defined experiments supported by appropriate metrics. You’ve demonstrated a strong understanding of Spotify’s features and user motivations. The proposed experiments are not only practical but have the potential to bring substantial improvement to user experience and engagement.

### Areas for Improvement

While your submission is largely outstanding, make sure your test cells (percentage allocations) add up correctly for practical implementation, especially in larger real-world A/B tests, which might require more nuanced segmentation strategies.
