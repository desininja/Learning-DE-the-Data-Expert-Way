# Product Analysis & Experimentation Plan: Spotify

This document outlines an analysis of the user journey for Spotify and proposes three data-driven experiments to improve the product experience.

## 1. My User Journey with Spotify

As a long-time user, my journey with Spotify has evolved significantly from initial discovery to daily habit.

### Phase 1: The "Discover Weekly" Hook (The First 2-3 Months)

The moment I first signed up, Spotify's main appeal was its promise of unlimited music, but the feature that truly captivated me was the **"Discover Weekly" playlist**. It wasn't just a list of popular songs; it was a playlist filled with new artists and songs I had never heard of, but which perfectly matched my taste. This felt magical and made me a regular user. I moved from passively listening to radio stations to actively looking forward to a new, personalized playlist every Monday morning.

### Phase 2: From Discovery to Curation (The First Year)

After building a small library of favorite songs, my usage shifted. I began creating my own playlists for different moods and activities (e.g., "Work Focus," "Workout Jams"). The search functionality became my primary tool, and the "Liked Songs" feature served as a a personal library. At this stage, I was no longer a passive recipient of recommendations; I became an active curator of my own music library, using Spotify's tools to build a collection. The "Spotify Wrapped" yearly summary was an enjoyable capstone to this phase, providing a deep dive into my listening habits.

### Phase 3: The Habitual, Multi-Device Experience (Present Day)

My use of Spotify has now become a seamless part of my daily life. The most loved feature is the **cross-device continuity**. I can start a song on my phone while walking to my car and seamlessly transition playback to my car's audio system. Similarly, I can pick up where I left off on my computer at work. The addition of podcasts and the integration of video content has also made it an all-in-one audio platform. At this stage, the "For You" section, "Daily Mixes", and the personalized recommendations for podcasts have become my primary entry points into the app, solidifying my long-term usage.

## 2. Proposed Experiments

I would like to propose three experiments designed to improve user engagement and retention.

### Experiment 1: Enhanced Discover Weekly

**Objective:** To test if providing more dynamic, personalized updates to the "Discover Weekly" playlist throughout the week, rather than a single weekly drop, increases user engagement.

**Hypothesis:** Offering more frequent, smaller batches of new song recommendations will increase weekly user sessions and the number of songs saved from the playlist.

**Test Cells:**

* **Cell A (Control - 33% of users):** The current "Discover Weekly" experience. One playlist update per week on Monday.

* **Cell B (Treatment 1 - 33% of users):** The "Discover Weekly" playlist is updated with 5 new songs every two days (Monday, Wednesday, Friday).

* **Cell C (Treatment 2 - 34% of users):** The "Discover Weekly" playlist is updated with one new song every day. The user receives a push notification on their phone for each new track.

**Metrics:**

* **Leading Metrics:**

    * Number of sessions per user per week.

    * Number of songs saved to a personal library from the "Discover Weekly" playlist.

    * Time spent listening to the "Discover Weekly" playlist per week.

    * Push notification click-through rate (for Cell C).

* **Lagging Metrics:**

    * 7-day retention rate.

    * Monthly Active Users (MAU).

    * Conversion rate to premium subscriptions.

### Experiment 2: "Story-Driven" Podcast Recommendations

**Objective:** To see if presenting a podcast as a "story" or "series" with a clear narrative hook improves listener engagement and completion rates.

**Hypothesis:** Framing a podcast with a compelling summary and highlighting its episodic nature will lead to a higher number of episodes listened to and a greater likelihood of a user following the show.

**Test Cells:**

* **Cell A (Control - 50% of users):** The current podcast recommendation format. Recommendations are shown as a single show with a generic title and description.

* **Cell B (Treatment - 50% of users):** Recommendations are presented in a new "Story" carousel on the homepage. Each podcast has a short, compelling "logline" (e.g., "A true crime saga unravels over 10 episodes") and shows clear visual progress on how many episodes have been listened to.

**Metrics:**

* **Leading Metrics:**

    * Number of episodes played per user.

    * Episode completion rate (e.g., percentage of users who listen to at least 90% of an episode).

    * Number of podcasts "followed" by a user.

    * Click-through rate on the podcast recommendation carousel.

* **Lagging Metrics:**

    * 7-day and 30-day retention for podcast listeners.

    * Engagement with podcast-related features (e.g., sharing episodes).

### Experiment 3: Collaborative Playlist Invitation

**Objective:** To test whether lowering the barrier to entry for inviting friends to collaborative playlists increases social sharing and overall time spent on the app.

**Hypothesis:** A more prominent and simplified invitation process for collaborative playlists will increase the number of users who create and share these playlists, which in turn will boost engagement.

**Test Cells:**

* **Cell A (Control - 50% of users):** The existing "Invite Friends" process for collaborative playlists is nested within a menu. Users must go through multiple steps to generate a shareable link.

* **Cell B (Treatment - 50% of users):** A prominent, animated "Invite Friends" button is placed on the playlist screen, and clicking it immediately generates a shareable link to the user's phone's messaging apps. The button also suggests specific friends from the user's Spotify network to invite.

**Metrics:**

* **Leading Metrics:**

    * Number of collaborative playlists created per user.

    * Number of shares of collaborative playlists per user.

    * Number of new users acquired via shared collaborative playlist links.

* **Lagging Metrics:**

    * Weekly and monthly active user (WAU/MAU) counts.

    * Net Promoter Score (NPS) from users who create/join a collaborative playlist.

    * Reduced churn rate for users who create or join a collaborative playlist.
